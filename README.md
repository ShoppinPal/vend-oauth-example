## setup
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ShoppinPal/vend-oauth-example.git`
2. `cd vend-oauth-example`
3. `npm install`
  1. its not ideal but use `sudo npm install` if the permissions in your directory structure require it
4. `bower install`
  1. its not ideal but use `sudo bower install` if the permissions in your directory structure require it
5. edit `config/development.json` and fill out your vend developer `client_id` and `client_secret` which can be found here: https://developers.vendhq.com/developer/applications
  1. do not edit/change/substitute any other properties
7. `cd node_modules/vend-nodejs-sdk`
8. `npm install`
  1. its not ideal but use `sudo npm install` if the permissions in your directory structure require it
9. `cd ../..`

## run it - short & sweet version
1. finish setup as specified above
2. Make sure that your vend developer app is registered with Redirect URI: `https://<vendDomainPrefix>.localtunnel.me/token/vend`
3. `grunt server --subdomain vendDomainPrefix`
  1. so, if I have a vend store named: `blah123.vendhq.com`
  2. then I will register a Redirect URI: https://blah123.localtunnel.me/token/vend
  3. and *afterwards* run the sample with the command: `grunt server --subdomain blah123`
4. A new page will be automatically opened in your browser for you
  1. if the page doesn't laod within 10-20 seconds:
    1. stop the grunt cmd in your terminal using `ctrl+c`
    2. simply rerun it: `grunt server --subdomain vendDomainPrefix` ... localtunnel is a free service so I don't know if its being flaky or the code is using it poorly ... rerunning resolves the problem 1 times out of 3.

## run it - long boring detailed story
There is some magic happening behind the scenes on your behalf for this sample: a publically accessible url is being spun up so that Vend can talk to the code running locally on your machine. That url is of the form: `vendDomainPrefix.localtunnel.me` because there is a good chance that nobody else is using your store's vendDomainPrefix with localtunnel ... so stick to that. If its nto working for you, try substituting with another unique word or name when launching.

## tests
1. demonstrates how a 429 response code due to Vend rate limiting is handled: `NODE_ENV=development node tests/429.js`
2. attempts (doesn't work) to record a 429 response code from Vend by exceedign the rate limit: `NODE_ENV=development node tests/429-brute-force.js`
